# db-tournament
The final project for Udacity's Relational Databases Course--Lesson 5

## Overview
The project included the design and implementation of a Postgres database and python interface to coordinate player pairings in a Swiss-system tournament. tournament.sql sets up the database, tournament.py is the python interface to the database, and tournament_test.py is a test script that checks tournament.py for correct functionality.
